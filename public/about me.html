    <h2>I am passionate about my work.
        <p>I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use a Capricorn Spraying Painting machine to improve the quality of our finished product(spray painting pipes).</p>

    <h2>I am result oriented.
        <p>I am results oriented, constantly checking in with the goal to determine how close or how far away we are and what it will take to make it happen. I find this pressure inspiring and a great motivator for the rest of the team. In fact, over the past year, I was able to help my team shorten our average turn around time to market by two days.</p>
